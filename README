wolfcast - Wolfenstein-like raycasting
======================================

This is a quick implementation of a Wolfenstein-like raycasting rendering.
Currently, it renders walls, floors, ceilings, sliding doors and push walls,
but sprite rendering is still missing, and comments missing everywhere...

Someday I'll finish it...

The important file is game/raycast.c, the rest is code that I use on my games
for SDL initialization, etc.

All theory comes from this famous tutorial:

https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/ 

This is free software. See the file `COPYING` for copying conditions.

Getting the code from revision control
======================================

If you cloned the project from a revision control system (i.e. GitHub), you
will need first to use the GNU autotools to generate some files, in particular,
the `configure` script. Use:

    $ ./bootstrap

to generate the required files. You will need *GNU autoconf*, *GNU automake*,
*GNU texinfo*.

Compiling on Unixes
===================

The fastest way is to have SDL 2.0 installed and then type:

./configure --enable-x11 --enable-sdl-datadir --enable-debugmode

Play with removing --enable-x11 if it fails on your system. Removing
--enable-debugmode makes the program start in fullscreen.

Then, to compile type:

make

An executable `app` is generated. Then run by typing:

./app 

You can change between fullscreen and windowed mode by pressing Alt + Enter.

Compiling on Windows
====================

Install cygwin with i686-w64-ming32-gcc, bc.

Go to libsdl.org and download the development libraries for mingw.

Inside cygwin terminal and inside the sdl libraries folder type 'make native':
this will install the library.

Then compile the project with:
./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --enable-sdl-datadir
make

Data
====

The folder `data` must be in the same directory as the generated executable.
It currently contains some copyrighted material from the game `Blake Stone:
Aliens of Gold` by Apogee Software (ok, that is one wall, one door, one floor
and one ceiling textures). Please, don't sue me for this.

There is one wall texture by me, the sand-like: use that one at will.

You can purchase the full Blake Stone game from:

Installing
==========

Currently the configuration and make processed has not been tested for
installing, only for compiling and test this code...
